== Biography
I'm an *Algorithm Researcher* of the Computer Vision Group, [https://4paradigm.com/ 4Paradigm].\n
Before my industry career, I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Technology in June 2016 from [http://www.nju.edu.cn Nanjing University].\n
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Dec 2021, under the supervision of [https://cs.nju.edu.cn/wujx/ Prof Jianxin Wu], and I was in the [http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn LAMDA Group].\n

From Dec. 2019 to Dec. 2020, I was visiting [https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~yli/ Dr. Yin Li]'s group under the grant of China Scholarship Council (CSC).

We are hiring highly motivated interns/full-time algorithm engineers, If you have interests in my research topic, please contact me for more details!
== Research Interests
My research interests include: *Computer Vision* and *Machine Learning*. Currently, I'm focused on:
- *Video Understanding*.
- *Resource Constrained Deep Learning* in computer vision tasks.
- *Real-World, Low Cost Data Generation*.
- Video related vision tasks.
